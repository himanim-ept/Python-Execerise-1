#Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.

base = int (input("Enter the Base of the triangle :"))  # base for triangle
height = int(input("Enter the Height of thr triangle :")) #height for triangle
area = (base*height)/2 #formula
print("Area of a triangle is :",area)
